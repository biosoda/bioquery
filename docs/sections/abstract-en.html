<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
The RDF schema here described adapts and extends the  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/void/">Vocabulary of Interlinked Datasets (VoID)</a> (i.e. so-called here VoIDext). 
The VoIDext describes metadata about virtual links among distributed triple stores to enhance interoperability (i.e. data and semantic exchanges). 
A virtual link is an intersection data point between two or more data stores.
