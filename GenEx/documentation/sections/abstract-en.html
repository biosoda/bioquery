<h2>Abstract</h2><p>
Expression patterns are a major feature of gene description, and are captured in many expression related databases
 (e.g. Bgee, Expression Atlas, GENEVESTIGATOR, or Tissue).
  Yet comparison and interoperability among these heterogeneous data sources or providers is limited by a lack of
   agreement for describing knowledge of gene expression. Ontologies are recognized as an interesting approach 
   to achieve a consensus for knowledge representation, and allow to leverage semantic interoperability, 
   but are lacking for the domain of gene expression. The Relational Ontology (RO) contains preliminary efforts 
   to define terms for describing this domain. Notably, it contains expressed in and expresses properties (i.e. relations).
    Nonetheless, further work is still necessary to address the following issues: 
    (i) the representation of additional information related to
 gene expression, such as developmental stages, as well as absent in and highly expressed relations; and (ii) the 
 trade-off between virtualisation and materialisation for the sake of query execution time and data storage. Furthermore,
  we reuse parts of the data schemas of the ORTH and UniProt core ontologies to provide (iii) the capacity to interoperate
   with other biological databases from different knowledge domains which are still relevant to the gene expression domain.
    Moreover, different gene expression databases use distinct
      confidence scores to assert expressed in or absent in relations.
       Finally, we also consider during the GenEx development the cost of materialising all gene expression information and how to mitigate this issue.
         For example, just for Homo sapiens, 
         we can derive from the Bgee database hundreds of millions of expressed in / absent in assertions (i.e. triples).
