# BioQuery 
A repository for code and documentation of the BioQuery BETA system.

# Hint for users of the frontend

Some of the queries only work if you install a CORS plugin in your browser (e.g. Moesif CORS) to allow **C**ross-**O**rigin **R**esource **S**haring

## Relational-to-RDF (OBDA) mappings

The full set of Ontop mappings used to expose relational Bgee data as a virtual RDF graph is available in the [Bgee_OBDA_mappings](https://github.com/biosoda/bioquery/tree/master/Bgee_OBDA_mappings) folder.

## Federated Queries Catalog

The Excel spreadsheet containing the 12 federated queries used to evaluate our system are available in the [Queries](https://github.com/biosoda/bioquery/tree/master/Queries) folder. They can also be modified and executed in our template-based search interface at http://biosoda.expasy.org/build_biosodafrontend/ .

## GenEx documentation

The documentation for the GenEx semantic model, used to expose gene expression data from Bgee as a virtual RDF graph, is available at [GenEx documentation draft](https://biosoda.github.io/genex/) and the raw files in the [genex](https://github.com/biosoda/genex) repository.

## VoID extension documentation

The documentation of the VoID extension describing the virtual links between the datasets considered in our work is available at [VoIDext documentation draft](https://biosoda.github.io/voidext/) and the Turtle files in the [voidext](https://github.com/biosoda/voidext) repository by also including the metadata used in this project (i.e. [voidext_bioquery.ttl](https://github.com/biosoda/voidext/blob/master/ABox_examplar_data/ABox_application.ttl) file).

## Supplementary material

All supplementary material for the submission is available in the document in [Supplementary](https://github.com/biosoda/bioquery/tree/master/Supplementary).

## Source code for template-based search interface

The source code for the template-based search interface running on http://biosoda.expasy.org/build_biosodafrontend/ is available for reference in the [biosoda_frontend](biosoda_frontend) folder.
